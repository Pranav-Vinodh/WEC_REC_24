# Official Submission for WEC Recruitments 
* FakeReddit fake news detection Multi Modal Neural Network
* This Submission has a Jupyter Notebook which consists of a MultiModal Neural Network designed to recognize fake news through different modalities such as image and text.
* I have made use of **DistilBert** for encoding of the text modality and used **ResNet-34** for the image processing.
